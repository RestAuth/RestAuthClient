How to contribute
=================

RestAuthClient is Free Software and as such invites everyone to contribute in any way possible.

* If you find bugs or want to request new features, you can simply `file a new issue <issue-new_>`_
  in our `issue tracker <issue_>`_
* You can also join our XMPP/Jabber multi user chat at `rest@conference.jabber.at <muc_>`_.
* Our codebase is hosted on `github <git-web_>`_.
  You can fork our codebase and code your own improvements and do a merge-request to get your
  changes into the "official" codebase.
