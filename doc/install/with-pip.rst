Installation with pip/virtualenv
================================

RestAuthClient is `also included <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RestAuthClient/>`_ in PyPI, the
`Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/>`_. That makes it very easy to install this
library using :command:`pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install RestAuthCommon RestAuthClient

.. WARNING:: :command:`pip install` outside a virtualenv requires superuser privileges on most
   systems.
