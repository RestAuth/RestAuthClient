=== ABOUT ===
This library implements all features of the RestAuth specification and is a
reference implementation. It is written in pure python. It generally works with
python 2.6 or later (including python3). You can also use this library with
python2.5, if you take some precautions (see USING WITH PYTHON 2.5).

=== INSTALLATION ===
The library ships with a with a standard setup.py file, so you should be able to
install it with a simple

	python setup.py install

If you want to install the library in python 3.x, you probably need to invoke
the setup.py with python3:

	python3 setup.py install

===== On Debian/Ubuntu =====
The RestAuth repositories include packages of this library, python-restauth for
python 2.6 and python3-restauth. 

=== HOW TO USE ===
The library includes extensive epydoc documentation. If you have epydoc
installed, you can generate it with the 'doc' target in the Makefile:

	make doc

... which will create the files in the doc directory. The documentation is also
available online, please see:

	http://fs.fsinf.at/wiki/RestAuthClient.py

The examples directory includes a few examples, which you need to invoke from
the top-level directory.

=== USING WITH PYTHON 2.5 ===
In its default configuration, this library uses JSON to marshal/unmarshal data
sent to/received from the server. If you want to use this code with python2.5
you either have to install the simplejson library[1] or provide your own content
handler to the constructor. This content handler must be a subclass of
RestAuthCommon.handlers.content_handler.
